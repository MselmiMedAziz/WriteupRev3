keygen write-up for task reverse rev3 :

disassemble main
after the analysis of the code
we found that he compare with 2 var : length of the string and the ascii sum  
we found that the length must be 14 and the sum must be 1007
so we write a script to generate code to validate the challenge

you found the file and the script  below
